# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository is to visualize how some pathing algorithms work. This project is not only to display my progress while learning Ruby, but also to simply show how some algorithms choose their path to an end goal!

## A* Algorithm

### Examples

Here we can see that the algorithm is going to find the optimal path using heuristics. 

![Example 1](https://github.com/IrishFagan/AlgorithmVisualizer/blob/master/images/Screenshot_1.png)

Here we can see a semi-optimal path. The algorithm implementation isn't working as planned and the path isn't as efficient as it could be.

![Example 2](https://github.com/IrishFagan/AlgorithmVisualizer/blob/master/images/Screenshot_2.png)

Here we can see a sub-optimal path. The algorithm definitely needs revision at this point.
